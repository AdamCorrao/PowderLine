PowderLine Documentation
========================

PowderLine automates powder X-ray diffraction refinement from a declarative
JSON "recipe". It is the application layer over interchangeable refinement
engines — GSAS-II by default, or Bruker TOPAS v7 or the open-source
easydiffraction — returning standardized, machine-readable result tables. The
same recipe runs on any engine, which makes PowderLine a natural fit for
interactive, scripted, high-throughput, and autonomous workflows.

fresh clone to a finished refinement, on Linux or Windows.
