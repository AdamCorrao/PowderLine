"""GSAS-II gateway — check GSAS-II's reading of each atom's site after phase setup (A117).

GSAS-II misreads some orientations of the 2-fold sites in R32, R-3m and R-3c
(``:H``): it calls them general (``'1'``) with **double** the multiplicity, so the
site weight doubles and intensities are wrong even with nothing refined (EB-40;
probe ``re04_eb40_orientation_probe.py``: 4x the intensity). Some sites it cannot
name (``'sp'``), and then refining a coordinate or ``Uaniso`` crashes its
constraint setup (EB-05). Core is right at both, so the check is a run-time error
that names an equivalent position GSAS-II reads correctly: the first member of
the atom's orbit (core's order, :func:`powderline.symmetry.orbit`) that
GSAS-II's ``SytSym`` gives core's multiplicity and a name. Never a silent
substitution: the refined coordinates would differ from the recipe's.
