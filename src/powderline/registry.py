"""Gateway registry: discovers PowderLine gateways from the ``powderline.gateways``
entry-point group (master plan A17, A7).

Discovery is lazy: entry points are listed on first use and a gateway's
factory is imported (``ep.load()``) only when that gateway is first requested,
so importing this module (or ``powderline``) never imports an engine.

Each entry point targets an engine-free ``get_gateway`` factory returning a
:class:`Gateway` with two layers: the **schema layer** (``validate``,
``capabilities``) runs with no engine installed; the **runtime layer**
(``run``) imports its engine lazily and raises
:class:`~powderline.exceptions.EngineNotAvailableError` when it is missing.

``register_gateway(name, factory)`` is the explicit-registration escape hatch
for tests and development; an explicit registration takes precedence over an
entry point of the same name.

Entry-point metadata is written when the package is installed: after editing
``[project.entry-points]`` in ``pyproject.toml``, re-install the editable
package (``pixi reinstall powderline``) or discovery finds nothing.
