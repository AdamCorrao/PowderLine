"""PowderLine exception hierarchy and the structured-warning shape (engine-free).

Every PowderLine-raised error derives from :class:`PowderLineError`. The
gateway errors split along the schema/runtime layers (master plan A23, A5/A8):

- :class:`GatewayNotInstalledError` — no gateway of that name is registered at
  all (an out-of-tree plugin that is not installed). The only case where
  ``validate()`` cannot run.
- :class:`EngineNotAvailableError` — the gateway is present but its engine
  dependency is missing from this environment. Raised at ``run()`` time only,
  never by ``validate()``/``validate_only``. Also an :class:`ImportError`, so
  callers that caught the underlying import failure keep working (A52).
- :class:`EngineVersionError` — the installed engine is outside the gateway's
  supported ``ENGINE_VERSION_SPEC``. A hard error (A44).
- :class:`EngineExecutionError` — the engine ran and failed.
- :class:`SymmetryError` — core symmetry helpers (``powderline.symmetry``)
  cannot interpret a space group or site. Gateways convert it to their own
  error type (A61).

An invalid recipe raises pydantic's own ``ValidationError``, which lists every
problem with its field location. Recipe checks live in the schema models
(core + engine), so there is no PowderLine wrapper for it (A70).

This module must never import an engine (enforced by an import-block test).
