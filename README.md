# PowderLine

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/powderline/badge/?version=latest)](https://powderline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Automated powder X-ray diffraction refinement. You describe a refinement in a
JSON "recipe"; PowderLine runs it with [GSAS-II](https://gsasii.github.io/) (or,
optionally, Bruker TOPAS v7) and returns standardized result tables.

PowderLine gives you a programmatic, reproducible way to run Rietveld refinements
and single-peak fits without hand-driving GSAS-II.

- **Two workflow types:** Rietveld refinement (`GSASII_Rietveld`) and single-peak
  fitting (`GSASII_SPF`).
- **Refine what you need:** unit cell, atom coordinates, occupancies, isotropic and
  anisotropic displacement parameters, background, and peak broadening — each
  parameter individually flagged.
- **Three engines, one recipe:** GSAS-II by default, Bruker TOPAS v7
  (`engine="topas"`), or open-source easydiffraction
  (`engine="easydiffraction"`) — the TOPAS and easydiffraction paths import
  zero GSAS-II.
- **Materials Project integration:** simulate a pattern from a crystal structure.
- **Standardized outputs:** fixed-filename CSV/TXT reports plus a GSAS-II `.gpx`.

## 1. Install

PowderLine uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh) for reproducible conda environments.
GSAS-II is installed **automatically** by `pixi install` (it ships as a conda
package — no separate GSAS-II install).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nsls2/PowderLine.git
cd PowderLine
pixi install
```

Platforms: `linux-64`, `win-64`, `osx-arm64`. Running a recipe through TOPAS
additionally requires a Windows machine with `tc.exe` installed; generating the
TOPAS input files needs no TOPAS and no GSAS-II.

## 2. Getting started

Run the bundled LaB6 calibrant example:

```bash
pixi run kicker examples/example_LaB6/input.json
```

Results are written next to the recipe in `examples/example_LaB6/output/`:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `refined_parameters.csv` | Every refined parameter with its ESD (9-column table) |
| `LaB6_unit_cell_report.csv` | Per-phase unit-cell parameters + ESDs |
| `LaB6_peak_list_report.csv` | Reflection list (hkl, d-spacing, 2θ, intensity) |
| `fit_profile.txt` | Observed / calculated / background / difference |
| `dummy.lst` | Human-readable GSAS-II refinement log (Rwp, parameter tables) |
| `dummy.gpx` | GSAS-II project — reopenable in the GSAS-II GUI |

> `examples/example_template/` is a fill-in-the-blanks skeleton, not a runnable
> recipe — copy it to start your own.

## 3. Ways to use PowderLine

**Command line** — run or validate a recipe:

```bash
pixi run kicker <recipe.json>                  # run a refinement
pixi run kicker <recipe.json> --validate-only  # check a recipe without running it
pixi run topas-kicker <recipe.json>            # generate a TOPAS v7 .inp + .xye
```

Other flags: `--output DIR` (default: `output/` next to the recipe) and
`--verbose`.

**Python API** — load a recipe, run it, get pandas DataFrames back:

```python
import powderline, tempfile
from pathlib import Path

recipe = powderline.load_recipe_asset(Path("examples/example_LaB6/input.json"))

# run() writes its file reports into the directory you give it; if you only
# want the in-memory results, a throwaway temp dir works fine:
result = powderline.run(recipe, Path(tempfile.mkdtemp()))

print(result["rwp"])                 # weighted profile R-factor
print(result["refined_parameters"])  # DataFrame of refined values + ESDs

# Same recipe, TOPAS engine:
result = powderline.run(recipe, Path(tempfile.mkdtemp()), engine="topas")
```

The returned dict holds more than the two keys shown: the fit metadata
(`success`, `rwp`, elapsed time, which execution path ran, and the error +
traceback on failure) plus every tabular report in memory — the full
refined-parameter table with ESDs, the fit profile, per-phase unit-cell and
peak-list tables (dicts keyed by phase name), and the SPF peak/convergence
tables when single-peak fitting. Everything the CSV/TXT files contain, without
touching disk yourself.

The public API is `run`, `validate`, `load_recipe_asset`,
`validate_simulation_mode_parameters`, `RecipeModel`, and `GSASClient`.

**The GSAS-II server (used by default)** — refinements go through a persistent
server that keeps GSAS-II resident in memory (auto-started in the background as
needed), which is a large speedup across many refinements. Manage it directly,
or opt out per run with `--no-server`:

```bash
pixi run gsas-server status                 # start | status | stop | restart
pixi run kicker <recipe.json> --no-server   # force an isolated one-shot subprocess
```

**Simulate a pattern from Materials Project** (requires an MP API key in
`.powderline_config.yaml` — see `.powderline_config.yaml.example` — or in the
`MP_API_KEY` environment variable):

```bash
pixi run mp-simulate --material-id mp-2680 --output patterns/
```

## 4. Refinement Engines

PowderLine supports three refinement engines that all consume the same recipe format:

### GSAS-II (default)

The primary engine, installed automatically with `pixi install`. All workflow types
and refinement flags are supported.

### TOPAS v7 (optional)

Bruker's commercial refinement package. PowderLine generates a TOPAS `.inp` + `.xye`
from unmodified `GSASII_Rietveld` and `GSASII_SPF` recipes; running the `.inp` requires
a Windows machine with `tc.exe` installed. The TOPAS path imports zero GSAS-II.

```python
result = powderline.run(recipe, Path("output/"), engine="topas")
```

### easydiffraction (optional)

Open-source Rietveld engine. Requires the optional `easydiff` pixi environment
(easydiffraction needs Python ≥3.12; the default environment stays at ≥3.10):

```bash
pixi install -e easydiff
```

```python
import powderline
result = powderline.run(recipe, "output", engine="easydiffraction")
```

**v1 capabilities:** translates unmodified `GSASII_Rietveld` recipes; supports unit-cell,
scale, wavelength, Chebyshev background, Caglioti U/V/W + Lorentzian X/Y broadening,
and zero-shift refinement; multi-phase; simulation mode (no refinement flags set).
Rejects loudly (translation error) atom-level refinement flags, Kα₁/Kα₂ two-wavelength
recipes, refined Z / polarization / axial divergence / background peaks, and SPF
recipes. Fixed anisotropic ADP values are not modeled and are dropped with a warning.

**Profile model:** a nonzero `SH/L` automatically selects the Thompson–Cox–Hastings
profile with fixed FCJ axial-divergence asymmetry (CrysFML calculator; hkl peak lists
are recovered with a post-fit CrysPy calculation). On the identical LaB6 recipe,
GSAS-II reaches Rwp 6.01% vs easydiffraction 9.63% (both χ² < 1), and the refined
lattice parameters agree to well under 0.001 Å. The remaining Rwp gap comes from
background peaks (not modeled) and residual profile-model differences, so **compare
lattice parameters, not Rwp, across engines** — Rwp is not an apples-to-apples metric.

[PowderLine-devkit](https://github.com/NSLS2/PowderLine-devkit) (maintainers can
request access).
